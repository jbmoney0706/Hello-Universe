Hello-Universe
==============

Just exploring this website and its features
I am 28 years old, my name is Jacob Braun and I have lived in Saint Louis my whole life except for when I was at college for a few years.  I have one class left to take before I can finally graduate college.  I am taking a computer coding class called launchcode.com to learn about computer programming so that I can hopefully get a computer programming job after I complete and turn in my final project. I am also considering applying to the police academy.
